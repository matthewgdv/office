Get Started!
--------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  The pull request should include tests.

2.  If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
    your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
    feature to the list in README.md.

3.  The pull request should work for Python 3.7. Older versions are not supported.

4.  PEP8 guidelines should be followed where possible, but deviations from it where
    it makes sense and improves legibility are encouraged. Do not be dogmatic.

5.  This repository intentionally disallows the PEP8 79-character limit. Therefore,
    any contributions adhering to this convention will be rejected. As a rule of
    thumb you should endeavor to stay under 200 characters except where going over
    preserves alignment, or where the line is mostly non-algorythmic code, such as
    an extremely long descriptive string or function call.
